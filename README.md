This is a QmlWeb-based GUI viewer for `*.qml` files.

Based on [QmlWeb](https://github.com/qmlweb/qmlweb) and [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron).

This is not a replacement to Qt QML by any means and should not be used in
production.

The only purpose of this tool is to test QmlWeb and visually compare the rendered
results with Qt QML output (e.g. `qmlscene`).
